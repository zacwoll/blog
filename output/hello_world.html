<p>My name is Zigi, I'm a software engineer and a musician and I have lots of ideas
that I need to put up somewhere sometimes. I'm not much of a blogger but the
industry is frequently curious about the status of your website and as a creator
of music and software it may make sense to have a blog like this one to serve as
the platform for these things. I had a version one of the blog but I wasn't
really interested in working on it and it didn't really have any structure or
order, it was a mess of css and I've always wanted a more structured approach
but I felt I didn't really have any content I wanted to put out there.</p>
<h2>Enter Rust</h2>
<p>This little programming language has been on my purview for so long, but I never
was getting around to checking it out. I decided to give Rust a chance and I
really like it, I feel like a very powerful programmer with the borrow checker
and typesense at my disposal. I'm a project based learner so I started working
on little projects while I read the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">book</a> to
cement my understanding of the basics. This blog is made entirely using the
static site generator I'm building in Rust.</p>
<h2>Projects on Projects</h2>
<p>I wrote a small command-line program called Human Resources Tool (hrt) and the
book finished with a basic multithreaded webserver so I did the natural thing
and started combining them as a technical exercise. This static site generator
takes all the markdown files in the content and rebuilds them as html files with
a little markup for a uniform and connected approach.</p>
